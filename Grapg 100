    // what is graph
    // A grapg is collgection of nodes (also vertices) connected by edges. It is used to represent relationship like roads connected to cities
    // 2. What is the difference between a Directed and an Undirected Graph?
    // Directed grapg -> the edge have dirctection (like one way -road)
    // UNdirected grapg -> the edge have have no direction (like a toow way road)
    // 3. What is an Adjacency Matrix?
    // It is 2 d array (table )
    // matrix[i][j]=1 means there us an edge from node i to node j
    // matririx[i][j]=0 means there is no edge
    // What is Adjacency list
    // Insted of a big matrics we uses list where wach node store a list of its neighboau . it saves spaces
    // 5. What is the difference between BFS and DFS?
    // bfs breadhth first search ->visit all the neighboaur forst
    // dfs depth first search -> visit all the neighboaur first and then backtrack
    // 6. What is a Weighted Graph?
    // A graph where each edge has number (wiigth) like road distance between cities

    // 7. What is a Cycle in a Graph?
    // A cycle happen when you stater a nodes , follow edges and come back to the same node.

    // 8. What is a Connected Graph?
    // A graph where all the nodes are connected dirtected or indirectly
    // 9. What is a Tree in Graphs?
    // A tree is special grag ehere there are no cycle , there is exstly one path between two nodes.

    // 10. what is shortest path on a graph.
    // The shortest path is the path with the minimum total weight.

1. What is a graph in data structures?
A graph is data structre that consists of nodes (vertices ) and edges connecting them.it can be directed or undirected ans is used to replesent relationship between objects.
2. What are the types of graphs?
Directed graph->edges have a direction (a->b)
undirected graph -> edges have no direction (a-b)
weighted graph -> edges have a value (a-b, 3)
unweighted graph-> edges have no weights
cyclic graph-> contains a cycle (a path where first ans last nodes aree same.)
acyclic grapg -> graph no cycle
Adjancy Matrix->
3. What are the different ways to represent a graph?
Adjancy matrix ->a 2d array matrix[i][j]=1
Adjancy List -> An array of list where each nodes stores its neighbour.
4. What is the time complexity of BFS and DFS?
bfs=>o(v+e)
dfs=>o(v+e)
5. What is the difference between BFS and DFS?

uses => shortest path ,solving mazes ,cyclye detection
data structe -> queue and stack.
6. How can you detect a cycle in a graph?
